# GAN
In this project, we generate images using a generative model known as Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). We use 2 types of GANs for this assignment which are:
        1. Deep Convolutional GANs(DCGAN)]
        2. Self Attention GANs(SAGAN)
CIFAR10 dataset is used for this project and Frechet Inception distance is used as a metric to evaluate performance of the GANs.
